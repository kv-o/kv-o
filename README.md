## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm kvo, a software developer studying Computer Science at the University of Adelaide.

I am a systems programmer focused on writing software that solves problems in the simplest and most effective way possible. My software engineering principles are primarily inherited from the [Unix philosophy][1] and the [KISS principle][2], with a desire to create reliable, maintainable, and intuitive software.

Most of my programming experience is in Go, Python, and C, ranging from full-stack web development projects to toy real-mode 8086 assembly operating systems.

#### Notable projects:
  - [TaskCollect][1] (frontend for educational platforms)
