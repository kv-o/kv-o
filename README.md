## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm kvo, a software developer studying Advanced Computer Science at the University of Adelaide.

My software engineering principles are primarily inherited from the [Unix philosophy][1] and the [KISS principle][2], with a desire to create reliable, maintainable, and intuitive software. My main projects are available on [SourceHut][3].

Most of my programming experience is in Go, Python, and C, ranging from full-stack web development projects to toy real-mode 8086 assembly operating systems.

#### Notable projects:
  - [TaskCollect][4] (frontend for educational platforms)
